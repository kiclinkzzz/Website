            <p>Do you remember feeling invincible?<br>
                When there was trouble it was us against the world<br>
                We kept running, running through the night<br>
                Chasing the sun 'til anything felt right<br><br>

                Can you save me now?<br>
                I get lost up in the clouds<br>
                Can you save me now?<br>
                You were my gravity<br>
                Can you save me now?<br>
                When the ground drops out I get lost in the clouds<br>
                Save me now<br>
                You were my gravity<br>
                Now my world is shattering<br>

                Ooooh, you were my gravity<br>
                Ooooh, you were my gravity<br>

                You left me out there with no one but myself<br>
                In an open field for the lightning to strike me down<br>
                I was the moon, you were the sun<br>
                I can't seem to shine now that you're gone<br>
                Now I'm out of orbit cause you left without warning<br>
                Are you somewhere better now?<br><br>

                Can you save me now?<br>
                I get lost up in the clouds<br>
                Can you save me now?<br>
                You were my gravity<br>
                Can you save me now?<br>
                When the ground drops out I get lost in the clouds<br>
                Save me now<br>
                You were my gravity<br>
                Now my world is shattering<br><br>

                Ooooh, you were my gravity<br>
                Ooooh, you were my gravity<br><br>

                When you went away, thought I'd never be the same<br>
                Would the nightmare ever end?<br>
                If I could do it again I wouldn't change a thing 'cause it's made me who I am<br><br>

                And now I'm shattering<br><br>

                Can you save me now?<br>
                When the ground drops out I get lost in the clouds<br>
                Save me now<br>
                You were my gravity<br>
                Can you save me now?<br>
                When the ground drops out I get lost in the clouds<br>
                Save me now<br>
                You were my gravity<br>
                Now my world is shattering<br><br>

                Ooooh, now my world is shattering<br>
                Ooooh, you were my gravity</p>
